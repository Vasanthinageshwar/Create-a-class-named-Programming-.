Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, then the message "I love
programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, then in place of "programming languages" the name of
that String variable should be printed. (Read the string from the user through keyboard)
For example, while creating object if we pass "Java", then "I love Java" should be printed.

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class Programming
{
String s;
Programming()
{
s = "I love programming languages";
}
Programming(String s)
{
this.s = "I love "+s;
}
}
class Que1b_A3
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
String name=sc.next();
Programming obj1 = new Programming();
Programming obj2 = new Programming(name);
System.out.println(obj1.s);
System.out.println(obj2.s);
}
}
